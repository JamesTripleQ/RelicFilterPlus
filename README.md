# Relic Filter+
An unofficial update to Relic Filter (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1632445960).

Fixes Watcher relics not spawning, relics with the same name not being loaded into the filter list, hitboxes having a wrong offset and many other things.

The code for this mod was originally obtained using a decompilation of the orginal RelicFilter mod. While the mod has been tested several times there's still a possibility that some minor issues went unnoticed. Feel free to open an Issue here if you find any. I am aware that moded keywords keep their prefix is the filter menu but I haven't manged to fix that yet.
